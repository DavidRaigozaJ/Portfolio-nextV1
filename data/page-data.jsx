		"Hello! My journey in the cryptocurrency world began during my thesis project in Arts, where I proposed new ways to reconstruct social tissue. With Colombia about to sign the peace agreement, the government tasked the National University to rethink symbols and how to rebuild society. After studying at Emerson College in the US, I realized the potential of decentralized technology, such as Bitcoin, to offer a better way forward. During one summer, I created a crypto Peso and became immersed in the finance and crypto community on Twitter. My passion for creating and building drives me to find new opportunities to grow as a person and engineer.",
		"I'm a former musician turned designer engineer who rediscovered my love for the arts. During my journey, I realized that our relationship with symbols, such as money, can play a crucial role in shaping society and building a better future for our children. In my free time, I love nothing more than spending quality time with my family.",
